# StandUp

StandUp is a small application that will periodically remind you to stand up and leave your desk for a moment. StandUp is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).


## System Requirements

Java 14 -- download from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net) or [Oracle OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net).


## Installing

Download the latest archive file matching your OS from the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/dykstrom/standup/releases), and extract it somewhere on your hard drive.


## Using

Double-click the JAR file, or start it from the command line.

```
java -jar standup-<version>.jar
```

Replace `<version>` with the version of StandUp you installed, for example 4.0.0.

Click the `Hide` button to hide the application window and be reminded later. Click `File | Settings...` to configure things like how often you want to be reminded, and what messages to display. Enjoy!
