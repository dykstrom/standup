StandUp is a small application that will periodically remind you to stand up and leave your desk for a moment. StandUp is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).


## Installing

Download the latest archive file matching your OS from the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/dykstrom/standup/releases), and extract it somewhere on your hard drive.
